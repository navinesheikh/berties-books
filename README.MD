//Bertie’s Books is a dynamic web application built using Node.js, Express.js, MySQL, and EJS. It allows users to view a list of books, add new books, search for books by title, and view bargain books priced under £20. The application demonstrates how to connect a Node.js backend to a MySQL database, render pages dynamically using EJS templates, and handle user input through forms. To run the app, clone the repository, install dependencies with npm install, set up a MySQL database named berties_books with a books table containing fields for id, name, and price, then start the server using node index.js. Once running, open a browser and go to http://localhost:8000 to view and interact with the application. This project showcases fundamental concepts of web development, including routing, templating, database integration, and deployment to a virtual server.

I used the dotenv module to move the database credentials out of the code. The .env file contains DB_HOST, DB_USER, DB_PASSWORD and DB_NAME. In index.js I call require('dotenv').config() and use process.env.DB_* when creating the MySQL pool.

I also implemented secure user login and auditing features. Users can register with a password that is hashed using bcrypt before it is stored in the database. Each login attempt, whether successful or failed, is recorded in the login_audit table with a timestamp, and this history can be viewed on a dedicated audit page. Additionally, the application was deployed to the university virtual machine and configured to run continuously using Forever, ensuring the website remains available online.
